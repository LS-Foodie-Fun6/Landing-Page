      <h3>What is FoodieFun?</h3>
      <p>
        FoodieFun is a feature-rich "Foodie-Focused" journaling app that allows
        you to track the many aspects of your meal experience, such as:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>The date and time of your previous visits</li>
        <li>How long it took to be seated</li>
        <li>Experience with waitstaff</li>
        <li>Menu accuracy</li>
        <li>Photos and descriptions you uploaded from previous visits</li>
        <li>
          Ratings you posted for each previous visit, as well as an average over
          all visits
        </li>
        <li>and so much more!</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <p>
        What did you order here last time? How long did you have to wait to be
        seated? Were the waistaff friendly and helpful, or rude and dismissive?
        Was the "mild" Panang Curry really mild, or did it burn the tongue out
        of your mouth? With FoodieFun, you can quickly recall all the details
        you need to make a decision on where to dine.
