# Landing-Page
FoodieFun was a week-long project built and launched by a team of 5 developers + our awesome project lead.

As our team's sole UI Web Developer, my job was to put together a marketing site/landing page for the app.

While we had some design mockups going into this project, we decided to make some significant changes,
so in addition to UI development I took on some design responsibilities as well.

The marketing site is responsive, and was built with HTML and CSS/LESS.
